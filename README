Welcome to the https://github.com/akamai/atlas component. atlas is built using
[Google Go](http://golang.org) and, as a result, this repository is intended to
be included as a git submodule at

  src/akamai/atlas

along with other submodules for its dependencies in a git repo on GOPATH. An
example tracking repo is available here at

  https://github.com/akamai-tech/atls.io

To run atlas, install go (Debian package: golang-go), optionally install
[etherpad-lite](http://etherpad.org), clone the atls.io tracking repo above,
then run "make" in that repo.

Other fun:
